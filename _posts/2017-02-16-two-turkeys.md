I never saw turkeys in the wild. Actually, I never saw one even in captivity. This bird is not common to where I grew up and had been living before moving to the US. Last week I finally saw the whole two of them! My car just came right before a stop sign intersection, and there were the two of them - standing right at the middle of the intersection. 

Whenever my car, or any other car from another direction would attempt to cross the intersection, the couple would rush towards the moving object swinging their bright red-blue heads. The birds look was so important and serious and their movements were so synchronized, it was tough not to smile. 

I was wondering how did they manage to stay so synchronized, like one was the mirror reflection of another, and which of the birds took the leading part in dictating the movements and serious looks. 

It looked like they were trying to protect something. They probably thought the road intersection was their territory and so didn't hesitate to attack a much bigger objects that were trying to invade. 

I had to get out of the car to scare the birds away. Although, I was not very confident in making the scare-away movements, since the birds size was a bit intimidating, and the last thing I wanted is to be attacked by two of them for real. At the end they gave up their serious looks and cleared the intersection. I never thought I would see them so close. Birds can always make my day.
