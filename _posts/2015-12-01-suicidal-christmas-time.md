He left his office earlier than a normal time. He could not stay there longer. It’s been six months he was trying to start his life from the beginning, but heavy memories were after him all the time. Obviously, the change of a place did not make any difference. While the world around him could be changing, the world inside remained still as a dead autumn water after all the birds had gone to the South. He had a feeling someone is following him for a long time. It was his demons which were the reason for all the bad that happened not so long time ago. It is so easy to blame everything on them.

This new big city, with its gray sky and gray houses, he did not even try to have a closer look at it. People around were gray as well. Some of them seemed happy, though. Couples were the most irritating. Passing by, holding hands, talking and laughing. Two years ago he was one of them and at that time he never thought to notice that someone could be watching his wife and him enviously, that someone could be unhappy. Back then it was so easy to be happy and to think the others were happy as well.

He was roaming from one block to another, purposelessly starring ahead, starring at the passing by people, looking at silly Christmas shop installations. Little crowd of children were standing in front of the big expensive shop showcase. Some parents were taking pictures of their little treasures. He approached more closely and now could hear their gasping and feel their excitement of anticipation in the air. 

An Indian immigrant was selling fried chestnuts for 5 euros a small pack. Expensive Christmas snack. Nearby a little stand was radiating an aromatic smell of a hot spicy wine. Typical Christmas absurdity. Nuts for kids, wine for parents. 

Out of curiosity he cast his sight on the showcase. A huge, three meter ugly woman mannequin with glossy red lips was sitting imposingly, wearing huge Prada clothes. Her hands were hugging a red sparkly present box filled with numerous shiny jewelry. A dozen of little Teddy-bears were surrounding her, acting like if they were occupied with wrapping the box or helping the model with her marvelous look. The bears were mechanized, so they were constantly moving, always making the same movements. Stylized musicbox-like music was playing for an amusement of everyone who would pass by. 

“Absolutely ridiculous”, he thought, “do people really find it attractive and full of sense?”. Disgusted, he decided to cross the street since there were more of such glamorous showcases of this big shop along the street. It was becoming difficult to move along the street because of the happy crowd hanging around the installations and enjoying themselves. He wanted to be far from that.

Where to go now, and what to do, he didn’t know. He was sure he did not want to go back to his apartment. It felt even worse there – empty, dark and cold. There he would not find a support to warm up his icy heart. Whisky did a bad help. He was not looking for anything on the streets, either. But there, it was much easier to get distracted from dark suicidal thoughts. 

He could not remember anymore how long he had been roaming, and if he tried he would not be able to figure out where he was exactly. It was somewhere far from the downtown – the streets became more narrow and less crowded. While he was passing the bakery, he felt hungry and decided to buy some bread. Freshly-baked baguette was his common snack. He left and continued the same way, crushing the bread into pieces and sent them to his mouth one by one. Further on the left side there was a little park with a bus stop where an old beggar was sitting. The beggar was not even asking for money, he was only strumming something on a drum-like weird instrument.

He passed the beggar few steps and suddenly stopped. He was not sure what he was doing or thinking at that moment. He came back to the beggar, and stood nearby still chewing the bread and trying to see what that was doing. The beggar was a black old guy with lots of wrinkles on his tired face with the gray kinky hair, dressed up with shabby dimensionless clothes. 

“Life must have pulled him about hard”. The beggar, noticed to be watched, raised his eyes on the walker and stopped playing. Their eyes met and the walker opened his mouth like if he was going to say something. Maybe he just wanted to see there is someone who feels worse than him in life. An inconvenient pause.

– Life on the street must be hard, – he finally said it to the beggar. The beggar was looking at him tiresomely. He was not giving any response - he didn’t know if it is the beginning of something good or bad. Life taught him people are too unpredictable.The walker suddenly added: 

– Would you like to have a dinner in the restaurant with me?
