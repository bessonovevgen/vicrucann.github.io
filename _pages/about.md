> Hi there - I'm Victoria Rudakova, a researcher and developer at [Graphics lab](http://graphics.cs.yale.edu/site/) of Yale University. My current work specializes on application domains such as computer graphics, vision and user interaction. 

## Misc facts

* My **first programming language** was *assembly*, and my first programming Bible was a Russian book [Assembly For Dos, Windows and Linux](http://a.co/hNwBceL) by [Sergey Zubkov](http://cubbi.com/). My first high level language was *Object Pascal* within the *Borland Delphi* environment.
* I'm very **passionate** about programming and software development since it allows me to use my brain in order to solve puzzles, and gives me a power to create something from a scratch with my own-defined logic. 
* I love learning **new languages** - both machine and human. Although, I believe the machine languages are easier to tame.
* I obtained a **PhD in computer science** from [*École des Ponts ParisTech*](http://en.enpc.fr/en), one of the [oldest and most prestigious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_ponts_ParisTech) French Grandes Écoles. My research was conducted at [IMAGINE](http://imagine.enpc.fr/) laboratory with an emphasis on [camera calibration and image enhancement](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~rudakovv/manuscript_main_rudakovv.pdf).
* At my **spare time** I like to do rock climbing, [writing coding tutorials](https://vicrucann.github.io/tutorials/), human language learning and [reading of tech articles and books](https://vicrucann.github.io/resources/). I'm also big fan of non-technical books and Japanese animation.

## This site

One of the reasons I created this site was documentation of tips and tricks that I learn throughout my daily work. Very soon I discovered that tutorial format is most suitable for it. I post about [other non-technical topics of interest](https://vicrucann.github.io/posts/) as well, but much more infrequently.
