> Hi there - I'm Victoria Rudakova, currently working as a software engineer at [Density](https://www.density.io/). This blog was mainly created during my time working as a researcher at the [Graphics lab](http://graphics.cs.yale.edu/site/) of Yale University. You will find some past articles on computer graphics, computer vision and user interaction. Nowadays I work with different technology like time-of-flight and radar sensors, and while I still get to work within the domains of UI, graphics and vision, my focus had shifted onto ToF calibration and image/signal processing.

## Misc facts

* My **first programming language** was *assembly*, and my first programming book was [Assembly For Dos, Windows and Linux](http://a.co/hNwBceL). My first high level language was *Object Pascal* within the *Borland Delphi* environment. During my Master's I taught myself *C++* and prefer it since then.
* I'm **passionate** about programming and software development since it allows me to use my brain in order to solve puzzles, and gives me a power to create something from a scratch with my own-defined logic.
* I love using and learning **new languages** - not only machine, but human ones as well. I can speak Russian, English, French and recently started learning Japanese.
* After completing the Erasmus Mundus Master programme in [Color in Informatics and Media Technology](https://master-colorscience.eu/), I obtained a **PhD in computer science** from [*École des Ponts ParisTech*](http://en.enpc.fr/en), one of the oldes French Grandes Écoles. My research was conducted at [IMAGINE](http://imagine.enpc.fr/) laboratory with an emphasis on [camera calibration, lens distortion correction and chromatic aberration correction](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~rudakovv/manuscript_main_rudakovv.pdf).
* In my **spare time** I like to do rock climbing, cycle, [write coding tutorials](https://vicrucann.github.io/tutorials/), and [read tech articles and books](https://vicrucann.github.io/resources/). I also enjoy reading fiction books and playing Japanese mahjong. On rare occasions I like to play puzzle video games.

## This site

In the beginning the main reason I created this site was to document tips and tricks that I learned through my daily work. Very soon, however, I discovered that framing my posts in a form of a tutorial is much more suitable.

**Note:** this site theme was shamelessly forked from an awesome Jekyll theme [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/) by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/). I do not do any web development.
