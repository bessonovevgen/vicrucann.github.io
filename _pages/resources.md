In this list I try to include some not-so-well known resources that I found useful and fun. This list is occasionally updated.

# Books

* [Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual](http://a.co/hGdAB08) by John Sonmez - great resource on many aspects of software developers lifestyle and life management. From self-marketing to health and retirement - it covers varying topics. Many of them came quite useful for me.

# Media

* [Land any job you want](http://landanyjobyouwant.com/) - an unconvnetional career advice blog. In my opinion, one of the best career advice on the Internet. The blog often highlights different techniques on how to get way before any other candidate when applying for a job position. The author provides lots of real examples and step-by-step instructions on how to land your perfect job.

# Courses

* [Charismatic conversation](http://www.communicationfornerds.com/) is a great course that sometimes is run by Katrina. In the course she provides some of the greatest advices on how to hold yourself within many social situations. The main goal of the course is to learn how to build a solid rock network to help you get advanced in your career.

# Entertainment

* [Amanita Design](http://amanita-design.net/index.html) puzzle games. Beautiful, well-thought and very engaging. Yes, it engages your brain very well. I'm a big fan and always try to stay up to date with their news in order to get the new game as soon as it is released. If you ask, my favorite game is [Machinarium](http://machinarium.net/). 

* [Psycho Pass anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho-Pass) - if you like AI, robots and interested to see how the potential future might look like in 100 years, this fiction anime is worth discovering.
