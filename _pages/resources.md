In this list I try to include some of my favorite resources. This list is occasionally updated.

# Books

* [Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual](http://a.co/hGdAB08) by John Sonmez - great resource on many aspects of software developers lifestyle and life management. From self-marketing to health and retirement - it covers varying topics. Many of them came quite useful for me.

# Blogs

* [foonathan::blog()](http://foonathan.net) - some interesting articles from a C++ library developer.
* [KDAB's blog](https://www.kdab.com/category/blogs/) - blog by developers of Qt on C++, Qt, OpenGL and related tech news.
* [Land any job you want](http://landanyjobyouwant.com/) - an unconvnetional career advice blog. In my opinion, one of the best career advice on the Internet. The blog often highlights different techniques on how to get way before any other candidate when applying for a job position. The author provides lots of real examples and step-by-step instructions on how to land your perfect job.
* [Communication for nerds](http://www.communicationfornerds.com/) is a great blog on improving your social skills in a work environment. Real life advice and scientific backups make it a real gem.

# Talks

# Entertainment

* [Amanita Design](http://amanita-design.net/index.html) puzzle games. Beautiful, well-thought and very engaging. Yes, it engages your brain very well. I'm a big fan and always try to stay up to date with their news in order to get the new game as soon as it is released. If you ask, my favorite game is [Machinarium](http://machinarium.net/). 

* [Psycho Pass anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho-Pass) - if you like AI, robots and interested to see how the potential future might look like in 100 years, this fiction anime is worth discovering.
