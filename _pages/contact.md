Have a question? Noticed an error or broken link? Improvement suggestion?  

The best way to contact me is to send me a short and succinct message [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/vicrucann) or [write me an email](mailto:vicrucann@gmail.com). If it is content specific, you can leave a comment under the corresponding tutorial. I appreciate your feedback.

I can also be found on several other social networks if you want to reach out and / or follow me (I post fairly infrequently, though). My posts are along the lines of some curious tech news like computer vision and AI, articles on project management and lifestyle, not-so-well known but interesting open source projects, puzzle finds and events I attended, and some random photographs from my life.

If these sorts of things interest you, follow along on:
