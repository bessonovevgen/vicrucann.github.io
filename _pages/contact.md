Have a question? Noticed an error? Improvement suggestion?  

The best way to contact me is [to send an email](mailto:vicrucann@gmail.com). Or, you can leave a comment under the corresponding tutorial. I appreciate your feedback.

I can also be found on several other social networks if you want to reach out and / or follow me (I post fairly infrequently, though). My posts are along the lines of some curious tech news on C++, computer vision and AI, articles on project management and lifestyle, not-so-well known but interesting open source projects, puzzle finds and events I attended, and some random photographs from my life.

If these sorts of things interest you, follow along on:
